/*
This class is derived from the Character class.
A Wizard is a Character that fights by casting spells.
Spells inflict damage and require mana to be cast.

The Wizard class will have:

Variable called mana of data type int, random between 10-50,
representing a resource the wizard consumes to cast spells (Private member)
Variable called intelligence of data type int, random between 1-50,
measuring how strong the wizard spells are (Private member)
Public Getter functions to access these variables
Public Setter functions to change these variables
A parameterized constructor that takes name, hp, mana, and intelligence
A public function that overloads attack() implemented in the Attacker interface,
that will take a character as a parameter and reduce that characterâ€™s health
based on the intelligence of the spell
 */
